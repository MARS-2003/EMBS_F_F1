## How to Use This Repository on Windows (No Terminal Needed)

### 1. Individual Work
1. Open the repository in a web browser.
2. Go to your personal folder: `MARS/`, `YHK`, or `PlaceHolder`.
3. Add your code:
   - Click **Add file → Create new file**.
   - Name the file logically, e.g., `iteration1_led_blink.ino`.
   - Copy the **skeleton `.ino` file** (see below) or your code (skeleton.ino in your respective folder for reference).
4. Include a short description at the top of your `.ino` file (see **Iteration Description Template**).
5. Commit your changes:
   - Scroll to **Commit changes**.
   - Add a descriptive commit message, e.g., `Iteration 1: LED blink - Asifur`.
   - Choose **Commit directly to the branch/folder**.

### 2. Collaborative Tasks
1. All collaborative tasks are in the `team_tasks/` folder.
2. Usually there will be **one or two `.ino` files**, updated repeatedly with each iteration.
3. Everyone should also **commit their changes to their personal folder** as a backup.
4. When editing the team file:
   - Add a **short single-line comment** marking the changes you made.
   - Avoid overwriting others’ code sections.
5. If two members edit the same lines at the same time, GitHub will prompt to **resolve conflicts** in the web editor.
